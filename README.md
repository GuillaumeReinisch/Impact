Impact
======

The Interface for Multiscale Physics and ChemisTry intends to provide
a common interface to interact and couple multiple C++ libraries.
The interface can be either used directly from C++, or from 
a Python-based graphical integrated development environment.

Currently Impact includes the following libraries:

    - Atomism :
   Library to model motion of ponctual masses within a Lagrangian formalism (computation of
molecular thermodynamic data and reaction rates).

    - [Antioch](https://github.com/pbauman/antioch) : 
    High performance, thread safe, GPU accelerated, library for chemical kinetics.

    - [ Queso ](https://github.com/libqueso/queso) :
A collection of algorithms and other functionalities aimed for the solution of statistical inverse problems, for the solution of statistical forward problems, for the validation of a model and for the prediction of quantities of interest from such model along with the quantification of their uncertainties.
